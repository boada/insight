# Data

This folder contains all of the data that has either been downloaded from the web or processed and created by the pipeline.

You can delete everything in this folder and it should all be recreated when the notebooks are run in order.

The raw data files aren't going to be uploaded to github, for the reason I just mentioned. If you have trouble reproducing the data, feel free to reach out and I will try to help you.
