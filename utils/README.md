# Utils

This folder contains utility scripts to make things easier to work with in the notebooks.

The most important file is `strings.py` where I define what the training and testing features are in the models. That is particularly useful so I don't have to type the same big list of columns over and over and over.

Please modify with care because things are imported around the notebooks and changes can have repercussions.
